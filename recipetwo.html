                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Kimchi fried rice is a popular fusion dish originating from South Korea. <i><b>Kimchi</b></i> is spicy fermented cabbage that's origins can be traced back to 37 BCE-7 AD. At first it wasn't actually spicy, and the introduction to chilli peppers in the 17th century made it like it is today. Rice is a native grain to Asia, and when agriculture was first invented, rice was one of the main crops they farmed. Though the orgins of kimchi fried rice are unclear, it is assumed that it was made with the purpose of being an easy, cheap, low ingrient meal.</p>
      
        
        <p>Kimchi fried rice usually consists of overripe kimchi, leftover rice, green onions, and some type of meat (I usually eat it with pork). An egg is often times added. </p>
